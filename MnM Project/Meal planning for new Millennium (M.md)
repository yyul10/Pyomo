Meal planning for the new Millennium (MnM)

The ﻿﻿famous Diet Problem, which is an application of linear programming (LP), was first stated by George Stigler in the 1930's.  It was first solved by George Dantzig using the simplex method, and has gone on to become, perhaps, the most widely studied model in introductory optimization (linear programming) test books.  The goal of this homework is to bring information revolution of the past hundred years to bear on stating the Diet Problem in the context of our lives today.  We will refer to it as the Meal planning in the new Millennium (MnM). 

In order to do justice to this project, we wish to bring Internet resources, popular crowd-sourced recipes, as well as the idea of human-machine intelligence into focus via this completely re-vamped version of the diet problem.  Consider two roommates who are planning their meals for the week.  These roommates are friendly enough to share cooking and shopping responsibilities, but like all millennials, they are strapped for time and money.  However, they do have well-trained taste buds, and are interested in eating healthy, eating tasty meals, and eating within budgetary and dietary restrictions.  There are, however, other pressing restrictions as well: they are committed to school-work, participation in social causes, taking time to have fun beyond simply studying, shopping, and cooking.  

The MnM problem will focus on meal planning with an OR/MS twist:  the duo to will share shopping, cooking, and meal selection responsibilities, and will also have to respect each others schedules, budgets, dietary restrictions, and of course, their likes and dislikes.  They may use social media (and web sites) to get a sense of how well each might like certain recipes.  For instance, they might express their own preferences, and then find individuals who have expressed likes (and dislikes) for similar foods.  Such correlations may be useful in predicting which "likes" and "dislikes" (of recipes) may mean more to each of the individuals.  One might use some matrix-completion (see Netflix Prize) concepts to decide how we may use likes/dislikes to predict an appropriate objective function to predict individual likes/dislikes.  Any way, there are several constraints which should be accommodated.  The shopping should accommodate food requirements for 5 week days.  Also, the choice of recipes will guide how much of each ingredient is necessary for meals over 5 days.   There should also be constraints on how much cooking time may be used on any given day, and constraints on total food cost.  Thus the data set should include costs for each ingredient in a recipe.
